# Blackjack-Simulator
A repository for a blackjack simulator I am writing in R. Random n blackjack is the most up to date and interesting script imo. The n is the number of players at the table. I was inspired to write this after seeing a web page that demonstrates the central limit theorem that allowed you to select your statistic of interest and sample size, and then showed how the distribution of that statistic approaches a Gaussian distribution as the number of samples increases. I found this to be a very intuitive way to show how probability works, and wanted to adapt it to blackjack. This script simulates blackjack by building a deck of cards as a vector, and then proceeding to sample cards and removing them from the vector so that the probability of obtaining any given card for any given player changes as the script runs.
